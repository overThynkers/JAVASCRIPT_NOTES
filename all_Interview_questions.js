//? Answer: 1
//? false = 0, true = 1 → 0 + 1 = 1

//* Q10: What is output of true - false?
//? Answer: 1
//? true = 1, false = 0 → 1 - 0 = 1

//* Q11: Why does " " + 0 return " 0"?
//? Answer: Because space is a string, so number 0 is converted into string and concatenation happens.

//* Q12: What is difference between implicit and explicit coercion?
//? Answer:
//? Implicit → automatic conversion by JavaScript
//? Explicit → manual conversion using Number(), String(), Boolean()

//* Q13: What is output of 10 + "20"?
//? Answer: "1020"
//? Because number is converted to string due to + operator.

//* Q14: What is output of 9 - "5"?

// Interview Questions - JavaScript Functions
// ==========================================================

// * What is a function in JavaScript?
// ? A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions help organize code, improve readability, and reduce repetition.

// * What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?
// ? A function declaration is created using the function keyword and is hoisted. A function expression is assigned to a variable and is not fully hoisted.

// * What is function invocation?
// ? Function invocation means calling or executing a function using its name followed by parentheses.

// * What is the difference between parameters and arguments?
// ? Parameters are variables listed in the function definition, while arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called.

// * What is the return keyword in JavaScript?
// ? The return keyword ends function execution and sends a value back to the caller.

// * What happens if a function does not return anything?
// ? JavaScript automatically returns undefined if no return statement is provided.

// * What is a function expression?
// ? A function expression is a function assigned to a variable. It can be named or anonymous.

// * What is an anonymous function?
// ? An anonymous function is a function without a name. It is commonly used in function expressions and callbacks.

// * What is a named function expression?
// ? A named function expression is a function expression that has its own name inside the function definition.

// * What is IIFE in JavaScript?
// ? IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression. It executes immediately after being defined.

// * Why do we use IIFE?
// ? IIFE is used to create a private scope, avoid polluting the global scope, and execute code immediately.

// * What is function hoisting?
// ? Function hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving function declarations to the top of their scope before execution.

// * Are function expressions hoisted?
// ? No. Function expressions are not fully hoisted like function declarations.

// * What is the difference between a regular function and an arrow function?
// ? Arrow functions have shorter syntax and do not have their own this value, while regular functions do.

// * What is a callback function?
// ? A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function and executed later.

// * What is a higher-order function?
// ? A higher-order function is a function that accepts another function as an argument or returns a function.

// * What are first-class functions in JavaScript?
// ? JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens, meaning functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

// * Can a function be stored inside a variable?
// ? Yes. Since functions are first-class citizens, they can be assigned to variables.

// * Can a function return another function?
// ? Yes. JavaScript allows functions to return other functions.

// * What is recursion?
// ? Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself until a specified condition is met.

// * What is the difference between local scope and global scope?
// ? Variables declared inside a function have local scope, while variables declared outside functions have global scope.

// * What is a pure function?
// ? A pure function always produces the same output for the same input and does not modify external state.

// * What are side effects in functions?
// ? Side effects occur when a function modifies data outside its own scope, such as changing global variables or manipulating the DOM.

// * What is the difference between == and ===?
// ? == compares values after type conversion, while === compares both value and data type without conversion.

// * Can functions be passed as arguments to other functions?
// ? Yes. Functions can be passed as arguments because JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens.

// * What is a self-invoking function?
// ? A self-invoking function is another name for an IIFE, a function that executes immediately after being created.

// * What is the purpose of callback functions in asynchronous programming?
// ? Callback functions allow code to execute after an asynchronous task has completed.

// * What is the difference between function parameters and default parameters?
// ? Default parameters provide fallback values when arguments are not supplied during function invocation.

// * What is a rest parameter in a function?
// ? A rest parameter collects multiple arguments into a single array using the (...) syntax.

// * Can a JavaScript function have multiple return statements?
// ? Yes. A function can contain multiple return statements, but only one will execute during a single function call.

// * What is the difference between return and console.log()?
// ? return sends a value back to the caller, while console.log() only displays information in the console.

// * What is a nested function?
// ? A nested function is a function defined inside another function.

// * What is a closure?
// ? A closure is created when an inner function remembers and accesses variables from its outer function even after the outer function has finished executing.

// ! INTERVIEW QUESTION
// * Question: How do you remove duplicate values from an array? And if we don't want to mutate the original array, what should we do?
// ? Answer english me likhna hai

// ==========================================================
// * Removing Duplicates from an Array
// ==========================================================

// ? Removing duplicate values from an array is a very common task
// ? in JavaScript development, especially when dealing with user
// ? data, API responses, or any collection that might contain
// ? repeated entries.

// ? There are multiple ways to achieve this, depending on whether
// ? you want to mutate the original array or create a new one.

// ==========================================================
// * Key Concepts to Mention in the Answer
// ==========================================================

// ? 1. Using Set (ES6) - The most modern and concise way
// ? 2. Using filter and indexOf - Classic approach
// ? 3. Using reduce - Functional approach
// ? 4. Using forEach and includes - Manual approach
// ? 5. Performance considerations for large arrays

// ==========================================================
// * Method 1: Using Set (Recommended)
// ==========================================================

// ? Set is a built-in object that only stores unique values.
// ? This is the cleanest and most performant way to remove duplicates.

// Example:

const numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5];

// Creating a new array without mutating the original
const uniqueNumbers = [...new Set(numbers)];
console.log(uniqueNumbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5] (Original unchanged)

// ? Also works with strings
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "mango", "banana"];
const uniqueFruits = [...new Set(fruits)];
console.log(uniqueFruits); // ["apple", "banana", "mango"]

// ==========================================================
// * Method 2: Using filter() and indexOf()
// ==========================================================

// ? This method filters elements by keeping only the first
// ? occurrence of each value. indexOf returns the first index
// ? of a given element.

// Example:

const colors = ["red", "blue", "red", "green", "blue", "yellow"];

const uniqueColors = colors.filter((color, index, array) => {
return array.indexOf(color) === index;
});

console.log(uniqueColors); // ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]

// ? How it works: For each element, we check if its first
// ? occurrence index matches the current index. If yes, keep it;
// ? if no (meaning it appeared earlier), skip it.

// ==========================================================
// * Method 3: Using reduce()
// ==========================================================

// ? The reduce method builds a new array by checking if the
// ? current element already exists in the accumulator.

// Example:

const items = [10, 20, 10, 30, 20, 40];

const uniqueItems = items.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
if (!accumulator.includes(currentValue)) {
accumulator.push(currentValue);
}
return accumulator;
}, []);

console.log(uniqueItems); // [10, 20, 30, 40]

// ==========================================================
// * Method 4: Using forEach() and includes()
// ==========================================================

// ? A manual approach that gives you full control over the logic.

// Example:

const letters = ["a", "b", "a", "c", "b", "d"];

const uniqueLetters = [];
letters.forEach((letter) => {
if (!uniqueLetters.includes(letter)) {
uniqueLetters.push(letter);
}
});

console.log(uniqueLetters); // ["a", "b", "c", "d"]

// ==========================================================
// * Handling Array of Objects (Removing Duplicates by Property)
// ==========================================================

// ? When working with objects, duplicates are usually identified
// ? by a specific property (like id). Set alone won't work here
// ? because objects are compared by reference, not value.

// Example:

const users = [
{ id: 1, name: "Ali" },
{ id: 2, name: "Ahmed" },
{ id: 1, name: "Ali" }, // Duplicate based on id
{ id: 3, name: "Sara" }
];

// Method 1: Using filter and Map/Set for tracking
const seenIds = new Set();
const uniqueUsers = users.filter(user => {
if (seenIds.has(user.id)) {
return false;
}
seenIds.add(user.id);
return true;
});

console.log(uniqueUsers);
// [{ id: 1, name: "Ali" }, { id: 2, name: "Ahmed" }, { id: 3, name: "Sara" }]

// Method 2: Using reduce with an object as accumulator
const uniqueUsers2 = Object.values(
users.reduce((acc, user) => {
acc[user.id] = user;
return acc;
}, {})
);

console.log(uniqueUsers2);

// ==========================================================
// * Performance Comparison (Good to Mention)
// ==========================================================

// ? For primitive values (strings, numbers):
// ? - Set approach: O(n) - Fastest for large arrays
// ? - filter + indexOf: O(n²) - Slower for large arrays because
// ? indexOf iterates internally for each element

// ? For arrays of objects:
// ? - Map/Set tracking: O(n) - Recommended
// ? - reduce with object: O(n) - Also efficient

// ==========================================================
// * One-Liner Duplicate Removal (Quick Answer)
// ==========================================================

// ? If the interviewer asks for the shortest way:

const arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5];
const unique = [...new Set(arr)];

console.log(unique); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// ==========================================================
// * Interview Tip
// ==========================================================

// ? When answering this question, always mention:
// ? 1. Whether the original array is mutated or not (immutability is
// ? preferred in modern JavaScript, especially in React).
// ? 2. The Set method as the modern ES6+ approach.
// ? 3. How you'd handle objects (since Set compares by reference).
// ? 4. Performance considerations for large datasets.
// ? 5. That you understand multiple approaches and can choose based
// ? on the specific use case.
